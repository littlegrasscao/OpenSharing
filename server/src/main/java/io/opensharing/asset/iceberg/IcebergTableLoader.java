/**
 * Answers the Iceberg REST catalog's {@code loadTable} for a shared table.
 *
 * <p>An Iceberg table needs no replay to be read: its metadata JSON already says what its snapshots,
 * schemas and manifests are, and an engine that can read Iceberg does the rest. So this relays that
 * document and hands over credentials for the table's location, which together are the whole of what
 * a recipient needs — the same bargain as {@code dir} access mode, said in the shape Iceberg clients
 * already speak.
 *
 * <p>Credentials go out with every load, unlike a catalog inside one organisation where a client may
 * hold its own and ask for delegation only when it does not. A recipient of a share never holds any:
 * vended credentials are the only way it can read a byte, so there is nothing to withhold until it
 * asks.
