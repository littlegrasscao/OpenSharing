/**
 * Catalog backed by open-source Unity Catalog, over its REST API.
 *
 * <p>Three calls carry it, which is the whole integration: {@code GET /tables/{full_name}} to find
 * out where a table lives, {@code POST /temporary-table-credentials} to be let into that storage, and
 * {@code GET /tables?catalog_name=&schema_name=} to say what a shared schema holds today. Each is made
 * with the caller's own credential as a bearer token, so Unity Catalog decides whether a provider may
 * share a table and whether a share owner may still be read through, and this connector never has to
 * form an opinion about privileges it cannot see.
 *
 * <p>What it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Iceberg.</b> Unity Catalog's {@code DataSourceFormat} has no Iceberg member, so a table
 *       shared through here is Delta or Parquet. Iceberg tables in a Unity Catalog are reached
 *       through its own Iceberg REST endpoint, which is a different connector's job.
 *   <li><b>Volumes, models.</b> Unity Catalog holds them and has credential endpoints for them, but
 *       this server shares tables and schemas, so asking for anything else is refused here rather
 *       than answered with something the layers above would not know what to do with.
 *   <li><b>Columns.</b> The table's schema comes back on every response and is not read: nothing in
 *       this server uses a catalog-stated schema, since a Delta table's own log is the authority on
 *       its shape. The partition columns are kept, being cheap and stated plainly.
 *   <li><b>Access modes.</b> Which of {@code dir} and {@code url} a table can be read by is settled
 *       above, from the format and what this build can serve, and no catalog has a say in it.
 * </ul>
