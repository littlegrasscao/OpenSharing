/**
 * The seam between the sharing server and the system of record for assets. The server never talks
 * to cloud storage itself: it asks the catalog where an asset lives and asks it to mint scoped,
 * TTL-bounded credentials the recipient uses to read bytes directly.
 *
 * <p>Two operations carry the whole integration, and each has a counterpart in every catalog worth
 * plugging in: Unity Catalog answers them with {@code GET /tables/{full_name}} and {@code POST
 * /temporary-table-credentials}, an Iceberg REST catalog such as Polaris with {@code loadTable} and
 * {@code loadCredentials}. Nothing else is required of an implementation, so that the cost of adding
 * one stays close to those two calls. {@link #listChildren} is offered on top for a catalog that can
 * enumerate, and is what a provider needs to share a whole schema rather than a list of tables.
 *
 * <p>Implementations authenticate to the catalog as the {@link CatalogCaller} each request names,
 * and are expected to be thread-safe.

  /**
   * Resolves an asset to its physical location, as a given caller, so that a catalog owning
   * authorization can refuse. Called when an asset is added to a share and again when credentials are
   * vended, so a relocation is picked up rather than served from a stale snapshot.
   *
   * <p>What comes back is described by {@link ResolvedAsset}, including which of its fields are kept
   * against the shared object and which are only as current as this call. An implementation states
   * what the catalog says and nothing more: a field the catalog does not report is left null or empty
   * rather than guessed at, because a guess here is indistinguishable from an answer downstream.
   *
   * <p>Either way the caller is a provider-side principal, and what to ask of them is whether they may
   * share the asset — not whether they own it. Databricks, whose model this follows, lets anyone with
   * {@code SELECT} on a table or view add it to a share, given {@code USE CATALOG} and {@code USE
   * SCHEMA} on the parents that hold it; a connector demanding ownership would refuse a provider
   * Databricks allows. The other half of that rule, that the caller must also own the share, is this
   * server's own to enforce and is never asked of a catalog.
   *
   * <p>Adding names the admin making the request. Serving names the owner of the share the recipient
   * reads through, which is deliberate rather than incidental: a recipient reads by virtue of that
   * provider's access, so asking as them each time is what makes a provider who loses access take
   * their recipients' access with them.
   *
   * <p>A caller always carries both a name and a credential to act as them with, so an implementation
   * never has to decide what to do without one. A connector authenticates to the catalog as the caller
   * and lets it answer; there is no service identity to fall back to, because a read that succeeded on
   * the server's own access rather than the owner's would outlive the owner's.
   *
   * <p>This doubles as the existence check. There is no separate one, because every caller that
   * wants to know whether an asset exists also wants the metadata that proves it.
   *
   * @param caller the principal the request is made for
   * @throws AssetNotFoundException if the catalog has no such asset
   * @throws AssetAccessDeniedException if the caller may not do this with the asset
   * @throws CatalogAuthenticationException if the catalog rejects the connector's own credentials
   * @throws CatalogException if the catalog cannot be reached or refuses the request

   *
   * <p>Optional, and the only operation that is. A catalog that cannot enumerate is still a perfectly
   * good catalog for sharing individual assets, so this refuses rather than forcing every
   * implementation to answer; adding a schema to a share is then rejected up front instead of failing
   * later, when a recipient tries to list it.
   *
   * <p>Full {@link ResolvedAsset}s are returned rather than bare identifiers because the catalogs
   * worth plugging in already carry the metadata in their list response — Unity Catalog's

   *
   * <p>The caller is the owner of the share being read through, as it is for {@link #resolveAsset}
