/**
 * Publishes both APIs as OpenAPI, read from the controllers and the records they return.
 *
 * <p>The document is derived rather than written, so it cannot promise something the server does
 * not serve. What it is for is the other side of the wire: a recipient's engineer can point a
 * generator at it and get a typed client instead of hand-writing calls from {@code spec/protocols}.
 * The spec stays the normative definition of the protocol — this describes one rendering of it.
 *
 * <p>The two APIs are separate documents because they answer to different contracts and even spell
 * their fields differently: the protocol is camelCase and fixed by the spec, while the admin API is
 * snake_case and this server's own. Reading them as one would suggest a uniformity that is not
 * there.
 *
 * <p>Neither document is authenticated, since the filters cover only the two API prefixes. What a
 * server accepts is not a secret — every route in them is in the published spec — but a deployment
 * that disagrees can turn them off with {@code springdoc.api-docs.enabled=false}.
 *
 * <p>One thing OpenAPI describes poorly: the table read operations answer with newline-delimited
 * JSON, a stream of actions rather than one object, so their bodies appear as text. The README says
 * what a line holds.
