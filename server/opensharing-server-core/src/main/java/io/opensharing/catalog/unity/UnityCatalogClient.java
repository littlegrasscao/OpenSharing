/**
 * Speaks HTTP and JSON to a Unity Catalog, so that {@link UnityCatalogConnector} above it deals only
 * in what the answers mean.
 *
 * <p>Requests are authenticated as the {@link CatalogCaller} they are made for, one of two ways
 * depending on which {@link Credential} the caller carries:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Credential.BearerToken} presents the token as {@code Authorization: Bearer}. This
 *       client holds no identity of its own in that case, which is what makes the question one the
 *       catalog answers against the privileges of the principal it actually concerns.
 *   <li>{@link Credential.OnBehalfOf} presents this connector's own configured identity ({@code
 *       serverSecret}) instead, naming the catalog user id the request should be evaluated as — for
 *       a recipient's read, made long after that user's own request (if there ever was one) is
 *       over, with no token of theirs available to present.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Unity Catalog's JSON is snake_case, and the protocol this server speaks is not, so it is read
 * with a mapper of its own rather than the application's. Unknown fields are ignored: a catalog is
 * free to grow its responses, and a sharing server that fell over when it did would be a poor client.
