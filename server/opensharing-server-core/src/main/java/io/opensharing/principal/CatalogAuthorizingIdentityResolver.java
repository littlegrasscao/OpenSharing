/**
 * Resolves a provider-admin request's caller by asking the {@link CatalogConnector} itself whose
 * bearer token this is — see {@link CatalogConnector#authorize} — instead of maintaining a parallel
 * {@code opensharing.admin.principals} list or storing a copy of anyone's credential. Works with
 * whichever connector this server is configured with; today that is Unity Catalog, the only
 * connector that implements {@link CatalogConnector#authorize}, but nothing here is specific to it.
 * One resolver serves both standalone mode (a connector pointed at a remote catalog) and embedded
 * mode (pointed at the host's own loopback address): authorizing a bearer token is a general
 * connector capability either way, not something embedding adds.
 *
 * <p>Create and Create Recipient are the only two provider-admin operations the catalog is asked to
 * gate ({@code CREATE_SHARE}, {@code CREATE_RECIPIENT} — see {@link #privilegeFor}); every other
 * request resolves identity only, and this server enforces its own ownership rules on top (a share
 * or recipient may only be changed by the principal that owns it) rather than asking the catalog to
 * decide that again on every call.
